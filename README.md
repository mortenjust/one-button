# Tv is stuck in the past
The channel numbers on your remote is real estate. Tv networks pay big money to be close to channel 1. They know that the more people see their jewelry shop, the more people buy. They don't care if you feel entertained - even though you represent 99.9% of the viewers. This is classic spam, right in your living room. No wonder people are cutting their wires.  But the alternative - streaming - is not a lot better. You easily spend 30 minutes deciding on a movie or series to watch with the paradox of choice sitting next to you in the couch. And probably the business of suggesting movies that have the lowest screening fees. You also never _really_ know if your show is available on Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go or Amazon Prime. 

It's a lot of hard work when you just want to relax.

The one button remote is 
* A Google Now approach to tv shows
* Treating tv channels and shows as web pages, and then ranking them
* A way to hack the tv industry by being 100% independent; no set top box, no partnerships. Just a really smart remote control that is connected to the cloud (IP) in one end and the tv (IR) in the other. 

We can do this with a series of devices
* A simple one-button remote control. Feels great in the hand. One button. Turning knob for volume. Turn it on with the button. Go to the next highest ranking channel or streaming show with the button. And so on. 
* A gesture camera. Make a thumbs down gesture to go to the next channel.
* Built into a set top box like Android TV
